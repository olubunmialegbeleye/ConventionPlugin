# ConventionPlugin

### How to Use This Repository: A Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to the companion repository for the "[Gradle Convention Plugin for Android Developers — The Practical Beginner’s Guide](https://olubunmi-alegbeleye.medium.com/gradle-convention-plugin-for-android-developers-the-practical-beginners-guide-db84f5b10bdd)" article! This project is not just a final result; it's a living tutorial where each step is captured in its own Git commit. Following the commit history is the best way to understand how to implement convention plugins.

This repo has two branches:
- `main`: contains the state of the project after project set-up
- `solution`: contains the step by step solution

Each commit on the `solution` branch corresponds to a step in the article [Gradle Convention Plugin for Android Developers — The Practical Beginner’s Guide](https://olubunmi-alegbeleye.medium.com/gradle-convention-plugin-for-android-developers-the-practical-beginners-guide-db84f5b10bdd)

Check it out and give a clap.
